            The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming
            interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical
            structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and
            manipulated.
          </p>
          <p>
            In website development, DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is
            a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove
            elements from a website document. DOM manipulation is when we use
            JavaScript to add, remove, and modify elements of a website. It is
            very common in web development.

          How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.

          <p>
            There are 5 ways in which you can select elements in a DOM using
            selectors. <br /><br />

            1. getElementsByTagName() <br />
            2. getElementsByClassName()<br />
            3. getElementById()<br />
            4. querySelector()<br />
            5. querySelectorAll()

          What is event bubble?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API
            when an event is in an element inside another element, and both
            elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process
            that starts with the element that triggered the event and then
            bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. In event
            bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost
            element and then propagated to outer elements.

          What is a callback function and why will you use it?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
          <p>
            A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to
            another function and is intended to be called by that function at
            some point in the future. The purpose of a callback function is to
            allow for asynchronous execution of code.<br /><br />

            There are several reasons why you might use a callback function:<br /><br />

            Asynchronous operations: When you have an asynchronous operation,
            such as reading a file or making an HTTP request, you might want to
            specify a callback function to be called when the operation is
            complete.<br />

            Event handling: When you're handling events, such as a user clicking
            a button or a timer expiring, you can use a callback function to
            respond to the event.<br />

            Customization: When you want to allow customization of a function's
            behavior, you can pass a callback function as an argument to that
            function. This allows users of the function to specify their own
            behavior for certain parts of the function.<br /><br />

            Overall, callback functions provide a way to write more flexible and
            reusable code, allowing for a greater degree of customization and
            control over the flow of execution in a program.
